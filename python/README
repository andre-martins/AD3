Compilation instructions:

1) Go to the main AD3 folder and type

> make 

This should create a library file "ad3/libad3.a" and an executable file called 
"ad3_multi".

2) Type 

> cd python
> python setup.py build_ext 

This will create a shared library file called "build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/ad3.so".

3) In the python folder, create a symbolic link to that lib by typing 

> ln -s build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/ad3.so ad3.so

4) Run one of the example Python scripts, e.g., 

> python example_grid_diversity.py
