    This graph can take one of two forms:
    - simple form, where all nodes share the same set of L labels.
    - typed form, where each node is typed and the node type t defines the set
    of Lt labels that the node can take.
    
    The input parameters differ according to the form of graph.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    unaries : array or list of arrays
        `unaries` gives the unary potentials of the nodes of the graph. 
        In the simple form, for N nodes, this is a N x L array.
        In the typed form, for T types, this is a list of Nt x Lt arrays, where
        Nt is the number of nodes of type t, and Lt is the number of labels of
        type t.
    edges : 2-column array or list of 2-columns arrays
        `edges` defines the edges of the graph.
        In the simple form, for E edges, this is a E x 2 array, giving the
        source node index and target node index of each edge of the graph.
        In the typed form, this is a list of length T^2 of 2-column array, each
        such array defining all the Et1t2 edges from a source node of type t1
        to a target node of type t2, for t1 in [1..T] and t2 in [1..T].
    edge_weights : array of list of arrays
        `edge_weights` gives the pairwise potentials of the pairs of nodes
        linked by an edge in the graph.
        In the simple form, for E edges, it is a E x L x L array.
        In the typed form, it is a list of Et1t2 x Lt1 x Lt2 array, for t1 in 
        [1..T] and t2 in [1..T].
    verbose : AD3 verbosity level
    n_iterations : AD3 number of iterations
    eta : AD3 eta
    exact : AD3 type of inference

    Returns
    -------
    marginals : array
        Marginals for all nodes of the graph, in same order as the `unaries`,
        after flattening.
    edge_marginals : array
        Marginals for all edges of the graph, in same order as the 
        `edge_weights`, after flattening.
    value : float
        Graph energy.
    solver_status : str
        status of the solver.
