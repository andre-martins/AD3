2017-07-31 AD3 2.1.0 vlad@vene.ro
  Added some functionality and robustness to the Python wrapper:
  * Factor graphs now have verbosity=0 by default (in CPP as well.)
  * `create_factor_*` can now take `negated=None` for simplicity.
    Note: To allow this, the order of arguments in `create_factor_budget` and
   `create_factor_knapsack` was changed.
  * Add `PFactorGraph.solve` unified API for setting solver settings.
  * Make `PMultiVariable` objects friendlier with len, get/setitem,
    as well as `set_log_potentials` with a numpy array instead of a loop.
  * Add validation and bounds checking to variables and some factors, preventing
    many ways in which user error can lead to segfaults.
  * More examples and test coverage, all with Python 3 support.

  As of this release, AD3 is distibuted on pypi as binary wheels, simplifying
  the installation process.

2013-03-22 AD3 2.0.2 afm@cs.cmu.edu
  Fixed memory leak in generic factors due to some configurations not being
  deleted.

2012-10-10 AD3 2.0.1 afm@cs.cmu.edu

2012-09-09 AD3 2.0 afm@cs.cmu.edu
  New release with major modifications:
  * Ability of handling dense, sparse, and combinatorial factors,
    with binary or multi-valued variables.
  * Active set method for solving the AD3 subproblems.
  * Ability of handling user-defined factors.
  * Parses UAI files.
  * Can be compiled as a library.
